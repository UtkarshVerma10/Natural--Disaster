# Natural--Disaster



Code fun do
1. What I am planning to build?
I am planning to make an android app which alerts it's user about the various natural disasters around him ,categorise them according to their intensity and the impact they might have on the user . In extremely dangerous situation  the location of the user would be send to his predefined friends with an SOS message.
2.How does it work?
The app reads the data from the mentioned datasets in JSON format and  segregates them as per the users preferences of countries and his location. Then it detects for natural disasters including earthquake ,tsunami,volcano,flood ,
hurricane ,forest fires and storm.After that it alerts the user about them on a 3 level basis. Red zone : If the user is in middle of a calamity.
Yellow zone : If the user is near the  place of calamity and might be in danger in future .
Green zone: If the user is in a safe limit.
3.How users can get started with the project?
The person would need to install the app from platforms such as play store,etc.  and then allow the app to access their location. He can also choose the countries about which he wants to  get alerts of.
4.Datasets involved:
www. gdacs.org- Global disaster alert and Coordination services.For monitoring natural disasters around the world.
www climate.gov- a US based website but offers climate change data across the world
www.developers.google.com- for Google maps.
4.What technologies I am using?
I will be  designing the app in Android Studio in JavaScript.
